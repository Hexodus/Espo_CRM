This is an allmost untouched EspoCRM docker installation with some convenience features.

### Quick Start
Make an own `.env` file with the credentials of your choice. OR: If you're on Windows then just run the `generate_passwords.bat` for a more convenient password generation.
Run in the console `docker compose -up` and open it in the browser.
